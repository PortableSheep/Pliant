MicroVal - jQuery Validation Plugin
================================

MicroVal is a jQuery plugin for form validation, that tries to be very flexible as far as validation rules are concerned. It also allows defining rules via HTML comments.

You can find documentation and examples on the Wiki.

A small demo can be found in the source itself, and more examples will follow in the future.

Note: I actually work off a bitbucket repo, and mirror changes to github because I can't figure out hg-git currently. I check both for issues opened, but you can find the bitbucket repo at this addess: http://bitbucket.org/rushtheweb/microval/overview
